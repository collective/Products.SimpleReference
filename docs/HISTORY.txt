----------------

- factored out Reference Content Types from Products.SimpleAttachment branch
  to this product. Took over the functionality developed in
  Products.SimpleAttachment/branches/referencable_content_support now you
  can install/uninstall this feature independently from SA.
  And you can upgrade your SA to 4.x blob support which you should do
  right now, if you haven't yet!
- Initial release
